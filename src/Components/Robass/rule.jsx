        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          To succeed on Upwork, you need to trust that the people you're dealing
          with are honest, and that you're safe from things like fraud and
          scams.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          The T&S team is here to uphold that trustâ€”and keep you safe. We do
          that by establishing rules about what's allowed, and then identifying
          and dealing with anything (or anyone) that could damage trust in
          Upwork, whether the target is you, other users, or the Upwork platform
          itself.
